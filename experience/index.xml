      <description>Consulted and project-managed the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reporting cycle for three consecutive years for LivaNova Plc, a Nasdaq-listed medical device manufacturing company, with 9 production sites across various countries. Identified opportunities for improvement in GHG reporting following a gap analysis, review and health-check of previous reports. Prepared and presented findings to the LivaNova Board of Directors highlighting opportunities for improvement and optimization. Worked with external auditors and senior management to ensure timely delivery of an accurate and comprehensive GHG report to the LivaNova Board of Directors for the approval prior to submission to the UK Regulator and disclosure in the Annual Report to shareholders.</description>
